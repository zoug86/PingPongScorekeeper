This is an app created with HTML, CSS (Bulma framework), and JavaScript. The main purpose of this app is to record the scores of 2 players while playing Ping Pong. The winner is the one to reach the maximum pre-set score fixed with a dropdown menu (the HTML select element).

Give this fun game a roll and let me know what you think!
